# Project Ideas for story/mechanics

## STORY:
- Bad environment when the character not recycling (smth like the background getting dark, withered trees) 
- Then he recycled and the background with every recycled e-waste goes whiter and whiter
- Progression of the environment
- If with ending, ending statement like “you(user) looks around and sees everything got better and nicer”

## MECHANICS:
- “Shop” with an NPC where the user can go to recycle e-waste and the NPC gives like a “thank you, this is how your actions are helping”
- Other NPCs that you could assign “jobs” to (time system eg. 5 mins to craft this item etc..)        
- Gathering e-waste, like old batteries
- Inventory system
- Crafting system (combining scrap together to create something useful such as tools that you could use later in the game)
- Key system (buying keys in exchange of scrap from vendors or finding keys under the rubble while cleaning e-waste)
- Symbols as graphics if not too complicated
- ASCII borders to make the UI nicer

# First steps:
## Inventory
- most likely, a **subclass** to Game
- create method to display inventory (to start, just print the contents)

## Items
- they are related to Rooms, but also Inventory
- can be got on rooms
- how to define items?
- implement Inspect system to find Items around a room (maybe a “look around” command?)
